      <p>Git is a distributed version-control 
        system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for 
        coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of 
        files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear 
        workflows.</p>

      <header><h1>Introduction to Github workflow</h1></header>
      <p>The guide assumes you already understand what Git is and what it's used for.</p>
      <p>It assumes you already know how to create a repository using Github and clone it to your 
        local machine directory</p>
      <p>The core idea behind the Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take 
        place in a dedicated branch instead of the master branch. This encapsulation makes it easy 
        for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. 
        It also means the master branch will never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for 
        continuous integration environments.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="How_it_works">
      <header><h1>How it works</h1></header>
      <p>The Feature Branch Workflow assumes a central repository, and master represents the 
        official project history. Instead of committing directly on their local master branch, 
        developers create a new branch every time they start work on a new feature. Feature branches 
        should have descriptive names, like animated-menu-items or issue-#1061. The idea is to give 
        a clear, highly-focused purpose to each branch.</p>
        <p>In addition, feature branches can (and should) be pushed to the central repository. This 
          makes it possible to share a feature with other developers without touching any official 
          code. Since <i>master</i> is the only “special” branch, storing several feature branches on the 
          central repository doesn’t pose any problems. Of course, this is also a convenient way to 
          back up everybody’s local commits. The following is a walk-through of the life-cycle of a 
          feature branch.</p>
